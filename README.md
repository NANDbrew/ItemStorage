# Item Storage

## Description

Put items back in crates, replace the contents completely, or store items you normally can't store! Requires ModUtilities.

Item Storage adds additional functionality to storage crates to make them feel more like storage crates and less like magic item fabricators operating outside the known laws of reality.

## Features

- **Add items back to crates** - Accidentally removed a fish from a crate you planned to sell? Just right click to put it back in!
- **Replace contents of a crate** - Your goat cheese provisions are nada, but you're drowning in cooked salmon. What do you do? Put the salmon in a box and sell it! The goods a crate contains can be replaced when it is empty.
- **Store non-storable items** - Look, I won't judge you for having 37 assorted colors of Emerald Archipelago lanterns. I'm sure you have your reasons. And now, you have a place to put those lanterns! Place items which are normally non-storable in an empty crate, and enjoy your newly cleaned and tidied cabin.
